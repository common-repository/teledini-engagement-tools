WebRTC enabled tools that allow click-to chat, call, and/or video between you and your visitors while providing you valuable data about each visitor.

== Description ==

Teledini's (teledini.com) WebRTC enabled engagement tools allow click-to-chat, click to call and/or click to video between you and visitors to your blog, while delivering valuable data about the visitor to you.

Teledini’s multi-channel engagement tools can be placed on your blog (or any website) in less than 20 minutes. Teledini is completely free to set up and install. Teledini's free version includes; Feedback, About Us and Social Networking. Teledini's paid version is pay-for-usage only and adds; click to talk, click to chat and click to video. You are only charged for paid channels when you are connected to a visitor.

Teledini’s solution is comprised of three integrated components: 

= Call2Action EngagementWindow =

Website owners can place a unique Call2Action button on each page of their website. When a visitor clicks the Call2Action button, a sleek EngagementWindow slides out. Web visitors are offered a myriad of ways to connect with the business and can choose the interaction method they are most comfortable using. The choices include: Click-to- Talk, Click-to-CallMeBack, Click-to-Chat, Click-to-Video and Click-to- Message. Contact numbers and location information for the business are also delivered in the EngagementWindow. Teledini’s Call2Action EngagementWindow replaces the traditional “contact us” page on a website that is both antiquated and proven ineffective.

= DecisionEngine =

Teledini features sophisticated interaction routing. Each interaction is delivered to the right person at the right time. Web owners can choose to simultaneously ring multiple numbers, people and devices based on product or page. Salespeople have the flexibility to determine how and when they can be reached most effectively by choosing their numbers, devices and availability.

= CallerIQ =

CallerIQ helps to maximize the value of customer interactions by displaying key information about a web visitor at the instant the interaction is delivered to the right person. This enables immediate relevant responses to the web visitor and opens up tremendous tracking capabilities. CallerIQ reports make it possible to track online campaigns, banner advertising and site performance on a page-by- page basis not only periodically, but in real time as desired.
